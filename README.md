# EnRoute-X

### A tracking app for safety of your loved ones.

In the current situation we don't feel safe when our loved ones travell alone . So we come up with an idea to hunt this problem down a little bit.

#
## Project Idea 

We build a native app which run on all the platforms(android, web, ios). We basically build an app which tracks the users current location according to the travel details provided by user and notify the person who requested the location access and inform at a certain interval of time as per users choice.

#

## How will the EnRoute-x exactly work
our app as it's name suggest is very helpful in enrouting (tracking) the a x person ( your closed ones) in the oath no matter wherever they are going whenever they
are going.
our app will be tracking the exact path of a person , through which he or she maybe travelling .

### login page -
 we will allow the user to sign up  to our app via email or phone number .
 
### profile page -
this page will collect basic data of the user such as email , phone number , address , blood group , emergency contact.

### friend list-
we will allow the user to conncet with diffrent people on this app as friends . all the people in your friendlist can request you for your location .
it is the user's choice to provide with the acess or not. this page will be showing yoyr friend lust and details of all your friends .


### tracking x-
the user can track any of thier friends if there request is not denied by thier friend by just providing simple information such as email , phone number and so on.
so that the app can contact you in emergency situations / to send warning pop ups to you in case of need.

## Features 

- sos-alerts-

 This feature of our app will send emergency notifications to the list of friends whom you have allowed access to whenever your route is shifted from the one which is predefined in the app , or if the you are taking more time than the defined time in reaching your destination . 
 
 - privacy concern-
 
our app care about you and your personal data ,no one will be able to access your live location without your permission . even your own friends , if demand accees for your location won't be provided with the same without your permission.

- changing Destination-

 no one  even you will be able to change your destination once chosen . it will only allow change if you and minimum one , friends will give permission for changing the destination including you .

- permission -

 we will only be accessing your location , nothing more will be accessed . in emergency , if required our app will access mic and camera with your permission which is asked everytime when the tracking begins.
